# Tree-structured Attention with Hierarchical Accumulation for Query Plan Cardinality and Cost Prediction

## Ackonwledge

For the realization of the paper Tree-structured Attention with Hierarchical Accumulation [Tree-structured Attention with Hierarchical Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08046).

We use it in the database to perdict the cost of a plan and cardinality of the query plan.
